# promise
A javascript promise implementation with the [Promises/A+ specification](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec)

# How To Test
Since this implementation uses rather new features of ES6 to hide private fields and functions of class, so it requires node>=14.0.0.

To test the compliance with the Promises/A+ specification, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run test
```
